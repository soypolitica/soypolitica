				BIG BROTHOOT, RIGHTEOUS LEADER OF SOYCEANIA (Sharty, SOYSOC) - Victory Speech
		</span>
	</label>
	<p>Welcome, good people of the 'party. Today I can report that we have conducted a raid that has killed the leader of the Shemmy, the Discord user who is responsible for the barbaric grooming of Drawkleki and the thoughtless theft of the soyjaks.party and booru.soy domains. This is your victory! We are triumphant! In our long history, we have never had a more doubleplusgemmy day than this. By the help of our eternal ally, the Swinny, our raids were carried out with the combination of precision, speed, accuracy and boldness that the enemy did not expect. The death of the Shemmy's leader is the most significant achievement to date in our website’s effort to defeat this Discord splinter once and for all. Years from now troon and chud alike will speak of this day. Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort. There is no doubt that the Shemmy will continue to pursue raids against us. We must stay vigilant and defend our boards, defend our gems, defend our SISAs, and defend the future of the Soyteen Race.</p>
